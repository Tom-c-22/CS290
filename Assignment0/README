List of Five Websites: 

1. https://corvallis.craigslist.org/
Likes: User friendly, no pop up advertisements, questions, etc, utilitarian
Dislikes: No options for communication between users directly. 
If I was to improve this site, I would include a quick message box to ask buyers, a space for specific meet up times/locations, and perhaps a more visually appealing apprearance. 

2. https://jskis.com/
Likes: Great visual appeal that immediatly engages the viewer to look at the products and watch the video reels. Site loads quick. 
Dislikes: Very blocky design choice.
If I were to improve this website, I would make the pages less like a pamphlet. Also, reduce the size of photos so the entire image/product and information are viewable. I have a 16" laptop and can barely fit an entire image of skis on my screen. 

3. https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAn4SeBhCwARIsANeF9DL1qVHF7fbbLX5a47A7sWBlq7St_eam_YHlwjGW4FHgXFDTEh9aDVoaAi0hEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
Likes: Proffessional and clean design that displays products and allows the user to dive into segments of the website without finding the 3 lines that open to a list
Dislikes: Each time you exit a specific page for a line of products, it takes you back to the home page instead of a product directory. 
If I were to change this website, I would have a designated button that takes you to a page listing all the categories of products to eliminate the need to scroll to the top to find the three lines. 

4. https://www.ikea.com/us/en/
Likes: Each picture of a product has small circles that, when hovered over, display another product that the user could purchase or look at.  
Dislikes: There is a slight problem with overloading the viewer with information and deals to push products which makes the main page seem overwhelming. 
If I were to change this website, I would put the product categories towards the top to make it easy for the user to locate a specific item that they are searching for. Being a furniture retailer, this company may be trying to shove products into the users face as much as possible. 

5. https://www.alltrails.com/
Likes: The visual design on this website is very appealing to me. Also, at the top of the page is a search bar to specifiy the region you are trying to find a hiking trail in. This creates an easy path for the user to find what they are looking for instead of scrolling through filler material. 
Dislikes: As much as I like the search bar on the main page, there is no filter options to specify your seach. 
If I were to change this website, I would have both a search bar and filter options so the user doesn't have to search their area, then locate and change the filter options on the following page.
